CycleGAN with Keras
---

The official version of implementation is published in [Here](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN).
Check `tests/basic_usage.py` for the usage.

Notes:
- This code is based on Keras-2, please update to Keras-2 to run this code.
- (11/08/17) Good to know many people are interesting in this repository. However, since they stop developing Theano and Keras and TF updates after I wrote this code, this code is **NOT for actual training and deployment**. I strongly suggest you to follow my architecture with the latest API to rewrite a workable solution. Welcome any PL to update this repository.
